        <p id="p6"> Main differences between Sample past tense and Present perfect tense : </p>
        <div class="text " id="div1">
        <ol>
            <li>  we use sample past tense to show an action which happen happend in the past and have no connection 
            with present <br>
            Examples: I went to store yesterday <br>
            it means that i went out for shoping yesterday and I finished my shoping     
            </li>
            <li>We can use both the past tense and the present perfect tense to talk about things in the past
                <br> 
                <ul>
                    <li>I went to China</li>
                    <li> Did you go to China? </li>
                    <li> I have been to China </li>
                    <li> Have you been to china?</li>
                </ul>
                <li>
                     We cannot use a specific time with the present perfect tense.
                    <br>
                    Examples:
                    <ul>
                        <li>I went to China in 2007</li>
                        <li>Did you go to china in 2007?</li>            
                                    </ul>
                                    
                                    <li> We use present perfect to talk about experiences
                                        <br>
                                        Examples:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>

                                                I have tried raw fish 
                                            </li>
                                            <li>

                                        </ul>
                                        <li> We cannot use specific time in present perfect tense but we can tell 
                                            how many times
                                            <br>
                                            Examples:
